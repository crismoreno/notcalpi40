# Welcome to Cristina Moreno's Personal Portfolio Website 
## Project Description
Hello dear earthling 🖖
Welcome to my website!
I'm a Junior Front-End developer and designer based in Barcelona and looking for inspiration!
After finishing the degree (in design management) I was asked to manage several digital projects which made me notice that the relationship between designers and developers is a struggle . This fact pushed me to try developing end user interfaces by myself. After some research, I decided to take the plunge and go for the WALLAPOP SCHOLARSHIP AT IRONHACK and guess what...! I did it! Being that my entrance ticket to coding. I'm very very motivated and committed to learning as much as I can! 💪

## As a user I can...
- List:
	- Projects and view details about each of them.
- View CV, work Experiencia, Soft Skills and Tech skills about Cristina
- Talk to Cristina via chat
- Send Contact Form
- Direct link to resources related to Cristina such as: github page, linkedin, medium...

## How did I made this website? 👩🏻‍💻
Note that this is v.4 of notcalpi website. Versions from 1 to 3 were made entirely in Angular (no server) and being the DB a plain JSON file.
This new version of the website is developed in:
- Backend --> Node.js (Express), Mysql and Sequelize.
- FrontEnd --> Vuejs + Bootstrap
- Deployed on Heroku (Although I plan to make a deploy pipeline with Jenkins in a near future)

Also note that this new version of the website brings in many new features such as:
- Sending contact forms
- Improved filtering
- Real time chat
